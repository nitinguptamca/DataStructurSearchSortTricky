<h1>Program: Implement Binary Search Tree (BST)</h1>

Description:
For a binary tree to be a binary search tree (BST), the data of all the nodes in the left sub-tree of the root node should be less than or equals to the data of the root. The data of all the nodes in the right subtree of the root node should be greater than the data of the root.

Here is an example picture of binary search tree (BST):
