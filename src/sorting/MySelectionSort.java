/**
 * @author nitin Program: Implement selection sort in java. The selection sort
 *         is a combination of searching and sorting. During each pass, the
 *         unsorted element with the smallest (or largest) value is moved to its
 *         proper position in the array. The number of times the sort passes
 *         through the array is one less than the number of items in the array.
 *         In the selection sort, the inner loop finds the next smallest (or
 *         largest) value and the outer loop places that value into its proper
 *         location. Selection sort is not difficult to analyze compared to
 *         other sorting algorithms since none of the loops depend on the data
 *         in the array. Selecting the lowest element requires scanning all n
 *         elements (this takesn − 1 comparisons) and then swapping it into the
 *         first position. Finding the next lowest element requires scanning the
 *         remaining n − 1 elements and so on, for (n − 1) + (n − 2) + ... + 2 +
 *         1 = n(n − 1) / 2 Θ(n2) comparisons. E ∈ ach of these scans requires
 *         one swap for n − 1 elements.
