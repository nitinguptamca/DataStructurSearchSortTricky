 *         Program: Implement insertion sort in java. Insertion sort is a simple
 *         sorting algorithm, it builds the final sorted array one item at a
 *         time. It is much less efficient on large lists than other sort
 *         algorithms. 
 *         Advantages of Insertion Sort:
 *          1) It is very simple. 
 *          2) It is very efficient for small data sets. 
 *          3) It is stable; i.e., it does not change the relative order of elements with equal keys. 
 *          4) In-place; i.e., only requires a constant amount O(1) of additional memory space. 
 *         Insertion sort iterates through the list by consuming
 *         one input element at each repetition, and growing a sorted output
 *         list. On a repetition, insertion sort removes one element from the
 *         input data, finds the location it belongs within the sorted list, and
 *         inserts it there. It repeats until no input elements remain. The best
 *         case input is an array that is already sorted. In this case insertion
 *         sort has a linear running time (i.e., Î˜(n)). During each iteration,
 *         the first remaining element of the input is only compared with the
 *         right-most element of the sorted subsection of the array. The
 *         simplest worst case input is an array sorted in reverse order. The
 *         set of all worst case inputs consists of all arrays where each
 *         element is the smallest or second-smallest of the elements before it.
 *         In these cases every iteration of the inner loop will scan and shift
 *         the entire sorted subsection of the array before inserting the next
 *         element. This gives insertion sort a quadratic running time (i.e.,
 *         O(n2)). The average case is also quadratic, which makes insertion
 *         sort impractical for sorting large arrays. However, insertion sort is
 *         one of the fastest algorithms for sorting very small arrays, even
 *         faster than quicksort; indeed, good quicksort implementations use
 *         insertion sort for arrays smaller than a certain threshold, also when
 *         arising as subproblems; the exact threshold must be determined
 *         experimentally and depends on the machine, but is commonly around
 *         ten.
